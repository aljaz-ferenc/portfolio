          <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Aljaž and I am a
            self-taught front end developer. I have a master's degree in guitar,
            experience working as a guitar teacher, but now I would like to
            change my career path towards my newly discovered passion: front end
            web development. I enjoy learning new programming skills that allow
            me to build better and better projects, I am motivated and I strive
            to improve every day. My other interests include music, astronomy
            and photography.

            <p class="work__text--description">
              Wise Tracker is an app that allows users to track their personal
              finances and cryptocurrency investments.
            </p>
            <div class="how-it-works">
              <p>
                <strong>EXPENSE TRACKER</strong>: The user can input their
                monthly income and expenses. The app renders that data on the
                page and saves it in local storage. A budget is created and
                updated anytime the user adds or removes a transaction. The
                budget is visualized using Charts.js library.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>ENVELOPES</strong>: Based on envelope saving system,
                traditionally using physical envelopes and cash, the user can
                create virtual envelopes and add money anytime to save up for a
                specific expense.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>CRYPTO TRACKER</strong>: The user can add and track
                their cryptocurrency orders. Anytime a buy or sell order is
                added, the app will fetch the current price via Coin Gecko's API
                and calculate the order amount. The cryptocurrency is added to
                the user's holdings and the portfolio amount is updated.
                Autocomplete functionality is created from scratch using the API
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>CHARTS</strong>: The user can add assets to their
                watchlist, which will display the asset's chart. The charts are
                made using the Chart.js library and created dynamically by
                fetching the last 30 days of price data from the Coin Gecko API.
                Data from the same API is also used to dynamically create the
                list of available assets, their logos and symbols.

            <h3 class="work__text--header">Ear Trainer</h3>
            <p class="work__text--description">
              Ear Trainer is an app designed for my fellow musicians, helping
              them to practice the most common type of ear training exercises
              used in formal music education.
            </p>
            <div class="how-it-works">
              <p>
                The app has two types of exercises: listening and singing. The
                user can choose chords, intervals or scales they want to
                practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>LISTENING</strong>: In the listening section the app
                will play a chord, interval, or scale and the users job is to
                recognize what is being played.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SINGING</strong>: In the singing section the user gets a
                starting note and has to correctly sing the requested chord,
                interval, or scale.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program is given an array of notes. Classes are used to
                define distances between notes of every chord, interval and
                scale so the program can build any of them from any note. The
                app chooses a random chord, interval or scale and builds it on a
                randomly selected note. I used the Tone.js library to play the
                notes either all together or one by one. The app is built as a
                single page application by dispalying only the neccessary parts
                and hiding the rest. I also used JavaScript modules to make code
                more organized and reusable.

              </p>
              <p>
                The page is focused aroung using <strong>GSAP</strong> animation
                library. The first part displays a photo of a chosen space
                mission and information about it. Animations include hovering
                satelite, rotating planet, text being typed out letter by
                letter, random shooting stars and parallax effect on the
                background when the mouse is moved. The background was created
                using only Photoshop. Images and text in the timeline move into
                view as the user scrolls the page and the year of the mission
                counts up from zero.
